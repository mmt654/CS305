Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

 Artemis Financial is a financial consulting firm that creates individualized financial plans for savings accounts. They want to utilize modern security measures on their current software that encrypts and protects user financial information. They wanted their RESTful web application to be protected from external threats.

What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?

  I believe I did a good job in identifying problems with user authentication and the lack of steps. It is important to code securely so that it can keep out external threats and also if there is ever a breach it can limit what damage might be done. The value software security adds is almost irreplacable in the fact that it not only protects the company it protects the users and customers from being exploited by external threats.

What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

  The challenging part is being able to identify false positives but the helpful part is how it lays out all possible leaks and vulnerabilities in the system.

How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

  I would like to see more involved user authentication in artemis' code like two step authentication. I would use the vulnerability assessment and running the code over and over to try and find weak spots.

How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

  After refactoring the code I ran the vulnerability assessment again and tried to see if there were anymore vulnerablilites added to the list.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

  THe vunerablility assessment plugin is a huge help that I will definitely use in future projects along with the certificate creation and using different encrpytion algorithims.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

  I would like to showcase my skill level in identifying potential problems and the abilitiy to implement fixes and tools to identify these problems with the code.
